A benchmark of execution overhead. The main program only print "Hello World!" and compare the overhead of initialization between languages. I chose these languages because they are compiled languages and compilers are installed in my Laptop.

Compared Languages
==================

* C (dynamic / static link)
* C++ (dynamic / static link)
* Haskell
* Rust
